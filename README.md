# Pine

> Package manager faster than NPM

Pine is a _fast_ package manager that gets the packages that you need _fast_, and cleans up logging output to keep your terminal _clean_. It also compiles down to a package.json file so you can publish your packages to the NPM registery, giving you the option to use Pine in a package.
